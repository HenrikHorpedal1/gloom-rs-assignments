To get started, make sure you have `git`, `cargo` and, `rustc` installed and available.

You're free to write your report any way you'd like, as long as it is delivered as a PDF file.
To spread the word of *the one true way*, I have included a `pandoc` report skeleton in the `report` folder.
To use it make sure you have `pandoc` with a supported latex engine installed, making sure it works before using it to write your report.
