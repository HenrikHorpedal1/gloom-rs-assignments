\section{Task 3}
\subsection{a)}
I used a uniform varible to slowly modify each of the elements as the task suggested. This was what i observed for each parameter:

\subsubsection{a}
This changed the scaling along the x-axis.
\subsubsection{b}
This is shearing on x-axis.
\subsubsection{c}
This controls translation along the x-axis.
\subsubsection{d}
This is shearing on y-axis.
\subsubsection{e}
This is scaling in the y-axis.
\subsubsection{f}
This is translation along the y-axis.

\subsection{b)}
A rotation could bee seen as a combined shear and scaling-transformation. Since we only did one at a time, there was no rotation.
