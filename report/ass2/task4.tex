\section{Task 4}
I used the recommended key-binds, but added the key R as a "reset to starting-point" so that you don't loose were you are.

\section{Task 5}
\subsection{a)}
Coded it.
\subsection{b)}
I tried a lot of stuff to try to spot any difference when using `noperspective`, but I literally cannot spot any difference. My guess is that you need a more spesific scene to see a difference.

With smooth interpolation:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pictures/smooth.png}
\end{figure}

With `noperspective`:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pictures/not smooth.png}
\end{figure}
